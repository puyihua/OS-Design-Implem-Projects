=====================================================================

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

xv6-64 is a 64-bit port of MIT's xv6, by Anthony Shelton and
Jakob Eriksson, for use in UIC's Operating Systems curriculum. 

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, Austin
Clements, Anthony Shelton and Jakob Eriksson (64-bit).

The code in the files that constitute xv6 is Copyright 2006-2017
Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Russ Cox, Anthony Shelton and Jakob Eriksson.

ERROR REPORTS

If you spot errors or have suggestions for improvement, please send email to
Jakob Eriksson (jakob@uic.edu), or Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@csail.mit.edu).  If you have suggestions for improvements,
please keep in mind that the main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching operating
system. For example, we are in particular interested in simplifications and
clarifications, instead of suggestions for new systems calls, more portability,
etc.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run "make".
On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you will
need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing x86 ELF
binaries.  See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/tools.html.
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-".

To run xv6, install the QEMU PC simulators.  To run in QEMU, run "make qemu".

To create a typeset version of the code, run "make xv6.pdf".  This
requires the "mpage" utility.  See http://www.mesa.nl/pub/mpage/.
